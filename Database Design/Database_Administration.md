## Key Focus Areas
- Database architecture  
- Data security  
- Backup and recovery  
- Physical design and performance considerations  

---

## 2. Physical Database Design Overview

**Definition:**  
Physical database design is about translating logical data models into technical specifications for storing and retrieving data efficiently.  

**Goals:**  
- Ensure database integrity  
- Optimize performance  
- Guarantee security and recoverability  

**Key idea:**  
Logical design defines **what data is stored and how it relates**, while physical design defines **how and where it is stored**.

## 3. Normalized Relations

**Definition:**  
Normalization ensures data consistency and reduces redundancy.  

**Common forms:**  
- 1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF (most common in practice)  
- Higher normal forms (4NF–6NF) are rarely used in operational systems.  

**Physical specifications for attributes:**  
- Max length  
- Expected usage  
- Non-functional requirements (e.g., response time)  

**Insight:**  
Normalization ensures accuracy and consistency. However, excessive normalization may hurt performance due to multiple joins.  

**Real-life example:**  
In an e-commerce system, customer details are stored once in a `Customer` table and referenced by `Order` records via `CustomerID` instead of repeating customer data across all orders.  

---

## 4. Critical Design Decisions

**Definition:**  
Choices about data types, storage formats, indexes, and table structures that impact performance and maintainability.  

**Real-life example:**  
- Choosing `DATE` for birthdate fields ensures invalid dates like February 31 cannot be entered.  
- Creating an index on frequently queried product names speeds up searches significantly.  

---

## 5. Regulatory Compliance

**Definition:**  
Databases often need to meet legal and regulatory requirements that enforce data protection, accuracy, and security.  

**Key examples:**  
- **Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX):** Ensures accuracy and reliability of financial data.  
- **NIST standards (e.g., SP 800-53):** Provides guidelines for data protection, such as encryption.  
- **HIPAA:** Requires sensitive data protection in healthcare, often referencing NIST standards for implementation.  

**Key takeaway:**  
Compliance is about following **recognized standards**, not guessing security methods.  

**Real-life example:**  
- Banks following SOX must maintain auditable records of all financial transactions.  
- Hospitals following HIPAA/NIST must encrypt patient data and restrict access.

## 6. Data Types and Integrity

**Definition:**  
Data types define what kind of data a field can hold. Integrity rules ensure data is accurate and consistent.  

**Real-life example:**  
- Using `INTEGER` for quantity fields prevents invalid entries like “five.”  
- Referential integrity ensures an order cannot reference a non-existent product ID.  

---

## 7. IT Audits

**Definition:**  
An IT audit is a structured evaluation of an organization’s information systems, policies, procedures, and controls to ensure **data integrity, security, compliance, and operational efficiency**.  

**Why audits are needed:**  
- Ensure that critical business data is accurate, complete, and secure.  
- Verify compliance with regulatory standards (e.g., SOX, HIPAA).  
- Detect unauthorized changes or access.  
- Assess effectiveness of internal IT processes and controls.  

**Common audit focus areas:**  
- **Change Management:** Verifies changes are authorized, tested, and documented.  
- **Access Controls:** Ensures only authorized personnel can access or modify sensitive data (logical and physical).  
- **Operational Procedures:** Reviews backup routines, disaster recovery, and daily operations.  

**Real-life example:**  
A bank undergoing a SOX audit must demonstrate that only authorized IT staff can update account balances, all changes are logged, and reliable backups exist.  

**Insight:**  
Databases are **central to audits** since they store critical business information. Weak controls can lead to compliance failures, breaches, or financial errors.

## 8. Handling Missing Data

**Definition:**  
Strategies for dealing with incomplete or missing information, either by estimating, substituting, or ignoring it.  

**Real-life example:**  
If a survey respondent does not provide age, the system may substitute the average age of respondents for statistical analysis.  

---

## 9. Denormalization

**Definition:**  
Intentionally introducing redundancy to improve query performance by reducing joins.  

**Real-life example:**  
An online store might store product descriptions in both the `Products` and `Orders` tables to speed up order history queries, even though it duplicates data.  

**Insight:**  
Denormalization improves performance but increases integrity risks. Consider alternatives like indexing or query tuning first.  

---

## 10. Partitioning

**Definition:**  
Splitting tables into smaller units to improve performance, manageability, or security.  

**Types:**  
- **Horizontal Partitioning:** Different rows stored in separate files/servers (e.g., EU vs. NA customers).  
- **Vertical Partitioning:** Different columns stored separately (e.g., separating sensitive PII fields).  

**Pros:**  
- Efficiency  
- Better optimization  
- Security  
- Smaller backup units  
- Load balancing  

**Cons:**  
- Complexity  
- Potential inconsistent access speeds  
- Extra storage requirements  

**Insight:**  
Partitioning is mainly relevant for **large-scale, high-performance systems**.  

**Real-life example:**  
A global retailer stores European orders in an EU database and North American orders in a US database for faster queries and regulatory compliance.

## 11. Physical File Organization

**Definition:**  
How data is stored in files on disk, including heap, sequential, indexed, or hashed organization.  

**Real-life example:**  
A library database might store books sequentially by ISBN (sequential) or use an index to quickly find books by author name.  

---

## 12. Indexing

**Definition:**  
An index is a database structure that **improves data retrieval speed** by pointing to the physical location of records, reducing full table scans.  

**Why indexing matters:**  
- Speeds up queries for large datasets.  
- Optimizes searches on frequently queried columns.  
- Reduces system load, improving efficiency.  

**Types of indexes:**  
- **Single-column index:** Built on one column.  
- **Composite index:** Built on multiple columns for combined searches.  
- **Unique index:** Prevents duplicate values, ensuring data integrity.  

**Real-life use cases:**  
- **Healthcare:** Doctors search millions of patient records by `PatientID`, `LastName`, or `DateOfBirth`. Indexed fields allow queries like “patients born in 1980” to run in milliseconds.  
- **E-commerce:** Indexing `ProductName` and `Category` lets customers find products instantly during peak traffic.  

**Insight:**  
Choosing indexes requires analyzing **user query patterns**.  
- Too few indexes → slow queries.  
- Too many indexes → slower inserts/updates.  
Indexing is a balance between **read performance** and **write efficiency**.
